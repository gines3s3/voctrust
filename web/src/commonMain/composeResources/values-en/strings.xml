My technology stack is Kotlin, Android, Rails, and React.\n\nAfter graduating from Tokyo National College of Technology with a degree in Information Engineering, he joined TOKIUM Inc. in April 2016 as a new graduate, gaining 6.5 years of experience as a playing manager in the Android and web fields, and from January 2023, I will be fully committed to hiring engineers and building organizations as a DevHR.\n\nI love Kotlin and Idolmaster. As I spent more and more time as an iM@S Producer, my real job started to resemble a producer's job.My brain was destroyed by the "Ijigen Fes" at the end of 2023, and I have recently started working on Love Live! and is now branching out into Love Live!</string>
